<h4> Counting payments is like cutting cake. Its easy for a few people but hard for a party. </h4>
<p>The things you need to count payments properly:</p>
<ol>
<li>FedLoan login (or any servicer login) for payment history
</li>
<li>Most recent PSLF ECF. In some occastions you need all the past ones too. 
</li>
<li>Member's terms. Yes, all of them.
</li>
<li>Time!
</li>
</ol>
<p> on some occasions I can get a PSLF case all done in about 10 minutes or less, <strong>BUT</strong> I have had cases that
took me over 45 minutes because the payments were so jacked up.
<p>
<a>You need to make sure of a few things.You need to make sure you are counting from employment start date unless it is older than 
the consolidation date. From there, you will need to make sure the member is paying the full
amount on time and no later than 15 days. Use the terms as a reference. 
</a> 
<p>When a member has been on a $0.00 payment there will be no payment history. Check notes to make 
sure member was never on ISD and/or forbearance. If that's the case, just count 12 payments per terms.
