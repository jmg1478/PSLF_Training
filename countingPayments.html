<h4> Counting payments is like cutting cake. Its easy for a few people but hard for a party. </h4>
<p>The thing you need to count payments properly</p>
<ol>
<li>FedLoan login (or any servicer login) for payment history
</li>
<li>Most recent PSLF ECF. In some occactions you need all the past ones too. 
</li>
<li>Members terms, yes all of them.
</li>
<li>Time!
</li>
</ol>
<p> In some occations I can get a PSLF case all done in about 10 minutes or less, <strong>BUT</strong> I have had cases that
took me over 45 minutes because the payments were so jacked up.
<p>
<a>You need to make sure of a few things.You need to make sure you are counting from employment start date unless is is older then 
the consolidation date. From there you will need to make sure the member is paying the full
amount on time and no later then 15 days. Use the terms as a refernce. 
</a> 
<p>When a member has been on a $0.00 payment there will be no payment history. Check notes to make 
sure member was never on ISD and or forbearance. If thats the case just count 12 payments per terms.
