<h4> Talking is your strong suit!</h4>
<br>
<h2>"How many qualifying payments do I have."
</h2>
<p>All you have to replay with is, "At this time I do not want to give you an estimation because
I don't want to be to high or to low and the actual total. But good new is that once the 
application has been approved our PSLF agent John will reach out to you with the confirmed amount. 
Best part is that he will actually have an estimated date of completion too."
</p>
<p> This is the quickest way to get a member to not just drop the question but the fastest way to get the docs
back from them. When I talk to member and use this line I see them in my apply queue within the week.
</p>
<h2>"Is there an update on my application."
</h2>
<p>Repsonce here will be one of four things. <strong>Hint</strong>: Login into FL or servers if notes are older then 5 days. 
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>With Fedloan. </i> "At this time there is no update on you FedLoan account. John reviewed and submitted the application
on X/XX/XXXX and normally it take 4 to 8 weeks for the docs to be approved. As soon as they are though, John
will reach out to you Via emailed and call to go over everything. 
</li>
<li><i>With Fedloan. </i>"Yes! It looks like it was approved recently. I am sure your in Johns queue to reach out to
today or tomorrow but since you called I'll send him an email to do you case next and he will each out 
as soon as he is done reviewing everything." -Send a task to me and I'll get on it ASAP AKA end of day. 
</li>
<li><i>Other Servicer. </i>"Looks like your loans are still with your current servicer. There is no information
on the loan transfer to Fedloan at this current time. But as soon as there is an update John will reach out to you with 
the next steps in the process. From the submittion date it can take 2 to 3 months for the loans to be fully transferred."
</li>
<li><i>Other Servicer. </i> "Ohh, looks like there was an update the other day. Per a letter in your inbox your loans should transfer to 
FedLoan X/XX/XXXX. Once the transfer starts John will be reaching out to you to create a FedLoan Login and to make sure transfer us complete
with no issues." 
</li>
</ol>
<h2> "I don't think my payments are correct"
</h2>
<p>This is also has a few thing you can say depending on the case type and what has been completed.
<ol>
<li><i>PSLF 4 closed: </i>"Unforuntanyly, our PSLF manager has reviewed all payments and comfirmed they are accuracy."
Then explaine dated and payment amount noted in case notes.   
</li>
<li><i>Working PSLF 4 docs post: </i>"Your documents posted recently John with reach out to you soon with the actual count and if there is
any issued he will schedule a confrence call with you." - Send task docs post
</li>
<li><i> PSLF 4 confrence call request: </i> "Yes, John agrees with you and in his notes he would like to do a confrence call to fix the issue.
When do you have a free time." - Come to me and see if I'm free if not I will give you times I am. 
</li>
<li><i>PSLF 3 or before: </i> "Unfortunatly, We need to complete the/a new application first. Once it is complete our PSLF
Specialist will review all the appoved docs and make sure everything is accuracte. If they are he will let you know and if there
is any discrepencies he will let you know and schedule a confrence call with FedLoan to fix the issue."
</li>
<br>
<p>This is basically the basics for ever basic question a member would ask. Always feel free to come up to me 
with a question you have or a member has.
