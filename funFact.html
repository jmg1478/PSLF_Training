<h4> FedLoan and their so-called Public Service Department.</h4>
<br>
<p> 
<ol>
	<li>As of Aug 8th, 2019 paid ahead status <u>does not</u> affect forgiveness or PSLF. As long as the member pays what is due it will count.
		(Doing a little more research into this but if this is the case NO MORE CCs FOR PAY AHEAD STATUSES! WOOT WOOT)
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Standard IDR payments count! This means if a member is in an IDR plan and they do not renew or standard is cheaper the payments they
		make will count. Now if the request by application or phone call to be in their standard plan it will not count!
		</li>
	<br>
  <li>ALL docs are ran by a computer first.
	</li>
	<br>
  <li>Making a request to have payments recounted it puts
  the member into a queue.
	</li>
	<br>
  <li>Conference calls can be 15 minutes to over an hour long 
	  depending on the time of day and rep.
	</li>
	<br>
  <li>PartialÂ  payments count as long as the whole amount 
  is paid within the 15 day grace period.  
  </li>
	<br>
  <li> Member in paid ahead status does not affect PSLF payments.
  </li>
	<br>
  <li>Standard payments count <strong>IF</strong> member is in IDR Standard
	</li>
	<br>
  <li>9 out of 10 cases FedLoan is right on their counted Payments.
  </li>
	<br>
	<li> FedLoan, GreatLakes, Nelnet, and so on payments are all approved within 3 months. 
</li>
<br>
  <li> Transfers from Navient are taking close to 16 months for payments to be approved.
  Jobs approved right away on the other hand.
  </li>
	<br>
  <li>FedLoan will normally go over where the computers made the mistakes. 
	Some just put in a request and hang up!
  </li>
<br>
